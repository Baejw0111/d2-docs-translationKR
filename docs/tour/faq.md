# Frequently asked questions

## How does this compare to Mermaid, Graphviz, PlantUML?

We've created a website with detailed comparisons:
[https://text-to-diagram.com](https://text-to-diagram.com).

## Is this designed for small diagrams or complex ones?

Both. The syntax is kept minimal and unstructured to make small diagrams with as little
lines as possible. At the same time, the language includes IDE features like an
autoformatter, error messages, and comments to maintain large diagrams.

## Does the D2 CLI collect telemetry?

No, D2 does not use an internet connection after installation, except to check for version
updates from GitHub periodically.

## Does D2 need a browser to run?

No, D2 can run entirely server-side.

## Can D2 run on a browser?

Yes, with WebAssembly. We are working on including the build with the releases, as well
provide instructions and examples.

## Can I use D2 online?

We are working on an official API and Playground. Coming soon!
