# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please see the full doc on contributing on D2's Github:

## Help wanted

The above doc is for contributing to D2 core. However, D2's community often requests
things that the core team don't have the bandwidth to do (until D2 reaches 1.0, we're
aggressively prioritizing improvements that make D2 better for the majority of users).
Below is a list of features that could use your help. If you're interested in taking the
initiative, feel free to just start, or you can comment on a GitHub issue, discuss in
Discord, or email us (alex at terrastruct).
