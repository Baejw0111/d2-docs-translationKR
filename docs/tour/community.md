# Getting help & community

- We have a Discord channel here, <a
  href="https://discord.gg/NF6X8K4eDq">https://discord.gg/NF6X8K4eDq</a>. If you have a
  question or need help, you'll find responses quickest through this channel.
- Have a proposal, running into a bug, or anything else you want to discuss with the team
  and community? D2 uses [Github Issues](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2) to track all
  discussions and TODOs, feel free to open an Issue.
- If you have a private enquiry, please email us: hi@d2lang.com.
