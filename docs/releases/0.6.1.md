The globs feature underwent a major rewrite and is now almost finalized.

### Before

Previously, globs would evaluate once on all the shapes and connections declared above it. So if you wanted to set everything red, you had to add the line at the bottom.

```d2
x
y

*.style.fill: red
```

### Now

```d2
*.style.fill: red

x
y
```

We still have one more release in 0.6 series to add filters to globs, so stay tuned.

You might also be interested to know that grid cells can now have connections between them! Source code for this diagram [here](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2/blob/master/e2etests/testdata/files/simple_grid_edges.d2).
